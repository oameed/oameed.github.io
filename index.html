  <h3> High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization

  <p> <b>Abstract: </b>  Batch normalization is a key component of most image classification models, but it has many undesirable 
                          properties stemming from its dependence on the batch size and interactions between examples. Although recent
                          work has succeeded in training deep ResNets without normalization layers, these models do not match the test 
                          accuracies of the best batch-normalized networks, and are often unstable for large learning rates or strong 
                          data augmentations. In this work, we develop an adaptive gradient clipping technique which overcomes these 
                          instabilities, and design a significantly improved class of Normalizer-Free ResNets. Our smaller models match 
                          the test accuracy of an EfficientNet-B7 on ImageNet while being up to 8.7x faster to train, and our largest models 
                          attain a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 86.5%. In addition, Normalizer-Free models attain significantly better
                          performance than their batch-normalized counterparts when finetuning on ImageNet after large-scale pre-training on a 
                          dataset of 300 million labeled images, with our best models obtaining an accuracy of 89.2%.
